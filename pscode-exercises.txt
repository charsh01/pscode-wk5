// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

    declare input variables
    prompt user for input_a;
    prompt user for input_b;
    input_a + input_b = answer;
    display answer;


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

    declare int variable
    prompt user for int;
    divide int by 2;
    if remainder = 0, display "even";   
    else, display "odd";


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are


    get integers and make array;

    // average
    int sum = 0;
    for loop through array{
        sum += array[i];
        }
    var average = sum / 5;

    // find smallest and largest
    int smallest = array[0];
    int largest = array[0];
    for loop through array{
        if array[i] < smallest, smallest = array[i];
        if array[i] > largest, largest = array[i];
        }

    //write out results
    display "average = " average;
    display "minimum = " smallest;
    display "maximum = " largest;
